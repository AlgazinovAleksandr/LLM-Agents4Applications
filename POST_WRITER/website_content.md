Hi, I’m Aleksandr!
Currently I’m a Data Scientist at Sberbank (the largest bank in Russia) and a Computer Science graduate student at
Tsinghua University
, doing research under the supervision of the
THUIAR
lab. My research interests are Multimodal AI, NLP, Multi-Agent Systems, AI in Finance, and Time Series Analysis. Besides that, I enjoy solving practical Data Science problems in domains including but not limited to NLP, Multi-Agent Systems, Classical ML, Ranking, Time Series, and RecSys. I always wanted to apply my knowledge to real-world problems. Therefore, while studying, I’ve been constantly working as a Data Scientist at two largest banks in Russia (Sberbank and VTB Bank), which made me a high-skilled and high-experienced specialist in the AI-domain. My total experience in the AI field is 3.5+ years, including 2.5+ years as a Data Scientist, and 1+ year as an AI-Researcher.
Before coming to China, I studied Economics at
HSE University
, which is the best university in Russia for Computer Science and Economics. Already at the beginning of my studies, I became interested in Machine Learning. Hence, besides my main course work, I took many courses from the Department of Computer Science, such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Big Data, etc.
In addition to working and doing my research, I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experience with others. For instance, I was a speaker at the
Open Data Science conference
(in Russian), where I talked about the methods we used to detect time series anomalies, the challenges we faced, and the approaches we took to overcome them. On the top of that, I’ve recently started a
telegram channel
(in Russian), where I share my experience in terms of AI, studying, and living in China.
